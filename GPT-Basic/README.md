# GPT (Generative Pretrained Model) Overview

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of language model that utilizes the Transformer architecture to generate human-like text. It is trained on a large corpus of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific natural language processing tasks. 

## Using already built GPTs
1. Importing Required Libraries:
   To use already built GPTs, you'll need to import the necessary libraries. The popular transformers library by Hugging Face provides pre-trained
   GPT models and utilities for text generation.
   ```
   from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
   ```

2. Loading the Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer:

   GPT models are pre-trained on massive amounts of text data, making them proficient in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. We can
   load a pre-trained GPT model and its associated tokenizer.

   ```
   model_name = "gpt2"  # Specify the model name, e.g., "gpt2", "gpt2-medium", etc.
   model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
   tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
   ```
3. Generating Text with GPT:
   Using the pre-trained GPT model, you can generate text by providing a prompt or an initial input sequence. The model predicts the next token in
   the sequence based on the provided context.
