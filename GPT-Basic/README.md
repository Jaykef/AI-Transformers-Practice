# GPT (Generative Pretrained Model) Overview

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of language model that utilizes the Transformer architecture to generate human-like text. It is trained on a large corpus of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific natural language processing tasks. 

# Using a GPT
## 1. Importing Required Libraries:
To use GPT, you'll need to import the necessary libraries. The popular transformers library by Hugging Face provides pre-trained GPT models and utilities for text generation.
