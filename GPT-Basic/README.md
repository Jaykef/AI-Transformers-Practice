# GPT (Generative Pretrained Model) Overview

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of language model that utilizes the Transformer architecture to generate human-like text. It is trained on a large corpus of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific natural language processing tasks. 

# Using already built GPTs
1. Importing Required Libraries:

To use already built GPTs, you'll need to import the necessary libraries. The popular transformers library by Hugging Face provides pre-trained GPT models and utilities for text generation.

```
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
```

2. Loading the Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer:

GPT models are pre-trained on massive amounts of text data, making them proficient in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. We can load a pre-trained GPT model and its associated tokenizer.
