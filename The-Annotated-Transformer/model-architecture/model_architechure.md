## Transformer Architecture

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.

### Encoder and Decoder Stacks

Encoder
The encoder is composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers.
